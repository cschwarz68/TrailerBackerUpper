## General Information
We're developing a 1/10th scale vehicle platform with a trailer that can be used to demonstrate autonomous navigation with a camera. It will work in both forward and reverse and navigate on a one lane road. It will also be useable with a controller.


## Technologies Used
- Seeed Studio vehicle chassis
- Python 3.9.2
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

## Project Status
Project is currently in development.


## Room for Improvement
source files and assets have been dropped into the test folder for now. As they get cleaned up we should create a /src folder for the scripts we need to run the car and use /test for scripts we use to do offline tests.
This repo may eventually also be used to hold simulation software and visual assets used to simulate the car and train deep learning models.
