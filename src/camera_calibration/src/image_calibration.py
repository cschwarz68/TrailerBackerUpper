# This module determines distortion coefficients and camera matrix for fisheye distortion correction and saves this arrays as .npz files in .src/camera_calibration/calibrations
# module image_capture.py should be used for capturing images, as its output directory is the input directory of this module
# OpenCV reccomends at least 10 images be captured when using chessboard for calibration.
# I was did not see satisfactory results until I had taken over 20.
# I found that images needed to be taken from a range of angles and distances.
# As images are processed, a version of the image with the detected corners will be saved in ./src/corner_images.
# If any of these images do NOT have corner detection lines drawn on them, delete the corresponding calibration image, as it is not sufficient for calibration.

# How I calibrated: I ran image_capture.py, then took one or more images (not many at once). I then ran this module, while still leaving image_capture.py running
# This allowed me to add more and more calibration images until I felt the end result was undistorted appropriately and not cropped to a horrendously low resolution.


# The majority of this module is from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/camera-calibration-with-python-opencv/#, the only additions
# being filepath integration, saving of distortion and camera matrix arrays, and error calculation.
